# LMS (Mini Project - 3rd Semester)

We present the design and implementation of a laundry management system (LMS) used in a laundry establishment. Laundry firms are usually faced with difficulties in keeping detailed records of customers’ clothing; this little problem as seen to most laundry firms is highly  discouraging as customers are filled with disappointments, arising from issues such as customer clothes mix-ups and untimely retrieval of clothes. The aim of this application is to determine the number of clothes collected, in relation to their owners, as this also helps the users fix a date for the collection of their clothes. Also customer’s information is secured, as a specific id is allocated per registration to avoid contrasting information.

Laundry firms currently use a manual system for management and maintenance of critical information. The current system requires numerous paper forms, with data stores spread throughout the laundry. Often the information is incomplete or does not follow management standards. Records are often lost, requiring a process to ensure no vital information is lost.

A significant part of operating any laundry firm involves management and timely retrieval of great volumes of information. This information involves user information, clothing records history.  The goal is to automate laundry management system and make it error free.
